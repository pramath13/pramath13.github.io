    <h1>Fun with Filters and Frequencies</h1>
    <h3>~ Pramath</h3> <br />

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h2> Part 1.1 Finite Difference Operator</h2>
    <p>Below is the original cameraman image.</p>
    <img src="./results/cameraman_orig_img.png" alt="cameraman imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>Here is result of the image convolved with the finite difference operators D_x and D_y.</p>

    <p>Below is the graident magnitude image</p>
    <img src="./results/magnitude.png" alt="magnitude imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p> I then binarized this magnitude image by taking a threshold of greater than 79 pixel intensity to saturate to
        255 and the rest to go to 0. This threshold was set qualitatively in order to suppress false postive edges.
        Below is the result of this binarization.</p>

    <h2>Part 1.2 Deravative of Gaussian (DoG) Filter</h2>
    <p>A blurry image was created by convolving the original image with the gaussian kernel that was generated using
        cv2.getGaussianKernel(). Below is the blurry image.</p>
    <img src="./results/blur_cameraman_orig.png" alt="Blurry image" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>The process mentioned in Part 1.1 was then repeated with this gaussian blurred image. Below is the resulting
        image.</p>
    <img src="./results/gaussian_dx_dy_1.2.png" alt="gx_gy gaussian imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <img src="./results/magnitude_blur.png" alt="magnitude imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <img src="./results/threshold_blur.png" alt="blur imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>The differences are quite prominent where the edges are easily detected and more visible. The edges are also
        thicker and bolder.</p>
    <p> Next, the operation was combined into 1 singular convolution. The gaussian was convolved with D_x and D_y. The
        resulting filter is displayed as an image below.</p>
    <img src="./results/dog_dx_dy.png" alt="dog dxdy" width="auto" height="400">
    The same result is gotten as above with the the magnitude image generated as shown below.
    <img src="./results/dog_mag.png" alt="mag imgage" width="auto" height="400">

    <h2>Part 2.1: Image "Sharpening"</h2>
    <p>In this part, a sharpening filter was generated and convolved with the image of interest to get a sharpened
        image.
        The sharpening filter was generated by taking the impluse filter minus a gaussian filter, multiplying that
        result by
        some multiple and then adding the impulse filter. Using this filter under different multiplicative factors lead
        to
        results shown below.</p>
    <img src="./results/unmask_filter.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <img src="./results/sharpen_dog.png" alt="Sharpen Dog" width="auto" height="400">
    <img src="./results/sharp_city.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>It was noticed that as the number of high Frequency signals were added to the image, it appeared sharper with the
        edges being more prominent. </br> </br>For evaluation, a sharp image was blurred with sigma set to 2 and then
        that blurred image was sharped to get the original image. Below is the result.</p>

    <h2>Part 2.2 Hybrid Images</h2>
    <p>Using the idea of different Frequencies that our eyes are sensitive to, we can overlay images filteered at
        differing frequencies.</p>
    <img src="./results/input_img_fft.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>Here is the same FFT magnitude plot but after filtering the images.</p>
    <img src="./results/filtered_fft_2.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>Here is the FFt magnitude of the hybrid image.</p>
    <img src="./results/hybrid_fft.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>Here is the hybrid image of Derek and nutmeg.</p>
    <img src="./results/combined_hybrid.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>From close, it is einstein but from far it is schrodinger.</p>
    <img src="./results/raw_sch_ein.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <img src="./results/ein_sch_good.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>Another interesting example I created is where you can see a change in expression. From close, it looks like the
        woman is angry but from afar, she appears not angry. Below is the input images.</p>
    <img src="./results/raw_img_hybrid.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <img src="./results/angry_normal_blend.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>Here is an example of the hybrid image not working. In this case, the frequencies in both input were very similar
        therefore, it is not possible to distinguish the 2 images. It is supposed to be a man in close and a woman from
        afar.</p>
    <img src="./results/hybrid_fail_man_woman.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>From analysing the FFT spectrum, it was seen that the dominant frequencies between the images were very close and
        were not filtered out which is why the hybrid image failed.</p>

    <h2>Part 2.3 Gaussian and Laplacian Stack</h2>
    <p>Gaussian and laplacian stacks were implemented from scratch. The visualization below shows the laplacian stack at
        various levels. The
        top most row is the first level with lots of high frequency features. The left column is the apple, middle
        column is
        the orange and the right column is the combination of the 2 images.</p>
    <img src="./results/blend_lapl.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">

    <h2>Part 2.4 Multiresolution Blending</h2>
    The laplacian stacks were then blended together to create the "oraple".
    Below is the result.
    <img src="./results/img_blending.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>The "oraple" was created using a vertical seam. I then tried out various filters such as a horizontal seam and an
        irregular filter too. I created a function that takes in an image and generates a binary filter from its edges.
        That way, irregular shaped filters can be created with interesting results.
    </p>
    <p>Firstly, using a vertical seam, I blended 2 images of tahoe to create one super image. Below are the raw images.
    </p>
    <img src="./results/raw_fig_tahoes.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>Below is the combined image.</p>
    <img src="./results/tahoe_vert_blend.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>Using a horizontal seam, I blended an image of an airplane with another image of tahoe. Here are the raw images.
    </p>
    <img src="./results/raw_tahoe_seaplane.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>Below is the result.</p>
    <img src="./results/seaplane_over_tahoe.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>Finally, here are the results of the irregular mask. First, an image of an eye is taken and made a filter. Below
        is the original eye image.</p>
    <img src="./results/eye.jpg" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>Below is the filter that was automatically generated from my function - createmask.</p>
    <img src="./results/Feye_filter_irr_2.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>I then applied that filter to the image of tahoe and the eye shown below.</p>
    <img src="./results/raw_eye_tahoe.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>Here are the reuslts of the irregular eye filter. I also inverted the tahoe image to create a cool effect of
        looking through the lens of another person and the inversion of color is like a memory.</p>
    <img src="./results/eye_tahoe_irr.png" alt="Sharpen imgage" width="auto" height="400">
    <p>Here are some other interesting blends. Enjoy!</p>

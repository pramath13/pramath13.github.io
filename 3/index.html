    <h1>Face Morphing</h1>
    <h3>~ Pramath</h3> <br />

    <h2>Part 1: Defining Correspondences</h2>
    <p>First, facial keypoints were matched with my image and the target image that I want to morph to. This is needed
        to create correspondences for triangulation and morphing. Below is an image of the keypoints and the
        triangulation on both images. The image on the left is me and the right is the target image. The points in blue
        are the facial keypoints that were selected and the green lines show the triangulation. Delaunay triangulation
        algorithm was used to generate the triangulation.</p>

    <h2>Part 2: Computing the "mid-way" face</h2>
    <p>First, the average face shape was computed by averaging the keypoints on both faces. Next, both faces were warped
        into that average shape by computing the affine transformation matrix for each triangle on the image to the
        target face shape. Finally, the colors were averaged using inverse warping. Inverse warping was used so that the
        destination image does not have any "holes". This mapping would potentially map to partial pixels therefore
        needing interpolation to get the average color. Below is the average image that was computed using the above
        mentioned algorithm.</p>

    <h2>Part 3: The morph sequence</h2>
    <p>The algorithm mentioned in part 2 was used to create a morph sequence. The image was slowly morphed by adjusting
        2 parameters which were coded into the morph function - wrap_frac and dissolve_frac. wrap_frac controls the
        amount of morphing and dissolve_frac controls the weighted averaging of the colors between the 2 images. These
        parameters go from 0 to 1. The resulting gif is shown below. The gif can be restarted by clicking on it.</p>

    <script>
        const gif = document.getElementById('me_vicky');

        gif.addEventListener('click', function () {
            const currentSrc = gif.src;
            gif.src = '';
            gif.src = currentSrc;
        });

    <P>Below is another morph of me and Ajay Devgn (a famous bollywood actor).</P>

    <script>
        const gif1 = document.getElementById('me_ajay');

        gif1.addEventListener('click', function () {
            const currentSrc = gif1.src;
            gif1.src = '';
            gif1.src = currentSrc;
        });
    </script>

    <h2>Part 4: The "mean face" of a population</h2>
    <p>First, a sub-dataset was curated by me from the Helen dataset. This would represent the population. I picked the
        subset to be women images from the dataset. Next, using the keypoints provieded in the dataset, I created an
        average face of the women population. The subset consisted of 103 images, conprising of mainly caucassian women.
        Below is the mean face that I got.
    </p>

    <P>My face was morphed into the average women's face shape. Below is the result.</P>

    <P>The average women's face was morphed into my face shape. Below is the result.</P>

    <h2>Part 5: Caricatures </h2>
    <p>Using the average face of the population that I constructed in the previous part, I created a caricature of my
        face by extrapolating from the population mean. By increasing the extrapolation factor, the differences were
        made more prominent. Below is the result. As seen, my face was made thinner, longer and lighter.</p>

    <h2>Bells and Whistles </h2>
    <p>I change my expression to create a pouting face thereby creating an effect of lip-syncing. Below is an image
        showing the results if only expression shape morphing was done, if only appearance morphing was done and finally
        a blend of both.</p>

    <p>Below is a gif showing the seamless transition from a neutral smile to a pouting expression on my face. I also
        tried to color match to my lip color as much as possible. Feel free to click on the gif to replay it.</p>

    <script>
        const gif2 = document.getElementById('me_pouting');

        gif2.addEventListener('click', function () {
            const currentSrc = gif2.src;
            gif2.src = '';
            gif2.src = currentSrc;
        });
    </script>
    <p>I lightened my skin tone and smoothened my face. Below is the result.</p>
